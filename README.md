# Microcontroller-Based Washing Machine Simulation Using PicsimLab
This project simulates the control system of a washing machine using the PIC16F877A microcontroller and PicsimLab. The simulation replicates the core functionality of a washing machine, providing insights into control system design, automation, and simulation techniques for embedded systems.
It aims to provide a realistic simulation environment to develop, test, and analyze the control algorithms and logic required for intelligent appliance operation.

Features:
Simulation of washing machine cycles (e.g., normal, delicate, heavy-duty)
User interface for cycle selection, start/pause, and status display
Simulation of input sensors (water level, door status, etc.)
Motor control simulation
Error handling and buzzer notifications

Technologies:
PIC16F877A Microcontroller
PicsimLab (Simulation Environment)

Getting Started

Prerequisites:
MPLAB X IDE (or a compatible PIC development environment)
PicsimLab Simulator

Development:
Write your microcontroller code in MPLAB using assembly or C.
Compile and assemble your code to generate a HEX file.

Simulation:
Load the HEX file into PicsimLab.
Configure the simulated peripherals (display, sensors, motor) if needed.
Run the simulation to observe the washing machine control system in action.
